## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the development methodology, 
outlining activities, goals, roles, tools, testing procedures, timelines, 
risk management, documentation practices, and continuous improvement strategies.

The overall goal is to create a seemless, organized, workflow process that allows 
contributors to collaborate efficiently.

The software development process begins with ideation, where creative concepts
are generated as issues, followed by discussion, implementation, iterative refinement, and testing.

## Development Phases

### 1. Planning
The issues serve as a space where ideas are generated, refined,
and broken down into their sub-tasks. Team members contribute to discussions, prioritize features, and
outline the scope of the task. 

An optional backlog board will be available to refine concepts, set milestones, and create a transparent
and organized planning process.

### 2. Communication and Collaboration
The issues and optional backlog board will serve as a hub for project communication. 

### 3. Development
The project will benefit from members iterating through several versions of code
before reaching a solution. Through this series of incremental improvements,
members can build upon the lessons learned previously, enhancing the project in a
meaningful way, while remaining adaptible to new insights discovered.

This iterative development approach (agile in a way), will lead to a codebase
that aims to be secure, resilient, and organized solution, ensuring that the
final product aligns with the user expectations.

### 4. Testing 
Through the discussions and iterations, members will write unit test that adhere
to industry standards.

### 5. Documentation
Code comments will be written to enhance the understanding when necessary.
If a discussion would better explain the code reason, provide a link as a comment
instead.

### 6. Adjustment and Feedback
The discussions about project direction and feature implementation will occur as issues or the optional backlog board. In this way, maintainers to the project can have a full
view of the discussion history. Feedback regarding ideas is encouraged as this is
the only way to have a discussion and reach an optimal solution.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Due to the team size, all members are encourage to collabarate in every section
of the product. Repository admins are put in place to create stable development
and feature-testing branches.

As of now, there is only one team member. As the project grows, the roles and
responsibilities will be updated.

## Tools and Technologies

The project will be written in Rust. Additions to the project are not required to be written in rust if it makes sense based on requirements.

Members should be comfortable moving between languages as requirements demand.

## Quality Assurance and Testing

The release cycle will follow **Major.Minor.Patch.**
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features
- Patch: Bug fixes

With the iterative approach taken to the project, quality assurance and testing
will be incorporated into the software development process. The ensure that the
software meets the required specifications, the following items should be
considered during discussion and implementation:

1. Analyze the requirements
2. Plan appropriate tests (security, performance, regression, user)
3. Execute those tests
4. Use the results of the test for further discussion
5. Repeat

## Project Timeline

A stable version of the product will take 9 months. 

## Risk Management

Risks, hurdles, obstacles are to be expected. Through the discussions and
iterations, a solution-first approach can mitigate issues as they arise.

## Documentation

The documentation will be included in this repository as a README.md file.
