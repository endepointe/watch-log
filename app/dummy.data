A string slice (&str) is made of bytes (u8), and a byte slice (&[u8]) is made of bytes, so this function converts between the two. Not all byte slices are valid string slices, however: &str requires that it is valid UTF-8. from_utf8() checks to ensure that the bytes are valid UTF-8, and then does the conversion.

note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled
Replace <testname> with the name of the test you want to run. This will execute any test whose name matches the filter string. For example, if you have a test named foo, you can run it like this:
